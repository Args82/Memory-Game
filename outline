Memory card game
Objective:  to find all matching pairs until the board is clear
Rules:

1. Basics
  -Interactive site, for all ages, straight forward content, funny/fun game site "tone", create cool logo to put on my site (eventually on all my projects), Readme.md with game info,


2. Static content
    Heading
    directions
    user story?
    sidebar/nav with score, help, exit, # of tries left
    card grid layout
    Do I want links?
    levels? easy would have something like 20 tries, med 15? hard 12?

3. Design ideas
  -Find color inspiration(create folder) color schemes(depends on images used), font types,
  -layout(3 rows of 4 cards?)
  -Image folder: 6 pair of matching images, owls; cartoon? funny? one facedown image for 12 cards

4. Mockup/wireframe in google drive & folder
